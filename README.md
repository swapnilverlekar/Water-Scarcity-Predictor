# Water-Scarcity-Predictor

## About
As part of my final year project for my Undergraduate degree, we implemented an Application based on the Machine Learning model "Water Scarcity Predictor and Supply Scheduling" capable of predicting possible future water scarcity in a particular region based on the available water resource.

### Algorithms used:
- Linear Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Multi-Layer Perceptron Regressor

#### Features selected for Predicting the reservoir water level:
- Regional Rainfall
- Current Reservoir water level
- Population
- Daily Water Consumption

#### Frontend
The frontend was implemented using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript and Particles for dynamic background
#### Backend
The backend was implemented following the MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture using the Django framework in Python.
